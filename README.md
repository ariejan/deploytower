# DeployTower 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ariejan/deploytower.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ariejan/deploytower)

DeployTower is intended as a utility to support people to easily deploy apps to Heroku. The ultimate goal
is to make deployments of feature branches to different heroku apps as easy as possible for non-technical
project members (read: product owners and managers).

## Requirements

DeployTower requires a server or vps with ruby-2.1.0 and a postgresql database. It will also need access to 
your git repositories and heroku account.

Note that DeployTower will have to clone your code locally before it can push to Heroku. This means whatever
server you choose must be able to write to the local file system. At this time Heroku itself does not seem 
like a viable solution.

## Installation

DeployTower is a Ruby on Rails application. Detailed installation instructions will follow at a later time.

## Features / Wishlist

 - [ ] Manage Heroku targets
 - [ ] Manage git repositories
 - [ ] Perform deployments
 - [ ] Record deployment information (user, branch, time)
 - [ ] Before/After commands (e.g. backup restore, seeds, etc.)
 - [ ] Allow deployment of feature branches
 - [ ] Make targets lockable
 - [ ] Auto Deployments (branch following)
 - [ ] Capistrano support
